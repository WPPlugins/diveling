== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Where are the annotations stored? Are they kept on my site? 
A: All annotations are stored on Divelingâ€™s secured servers. Annotations are not stored on the server side of your WordPress page. There is no cost for any amount of annotations that are created on your page.

Q: Am I able to edit and block other users comments and annotations?
A: Diveling Annotation system does not allow web masters to control and delete content from the annotation system. However, your readers are able to block and mute users that they deem as spammers. We are also working on a feature that will filter out spammers.

A: Twitter authentication is used to help us verify user identities and reduce spam. Users do not have to post to twitter once they have created their annotation. Users are able to deactivate sharing through twitter in the main annotation console.

Q: Do users have to share their annotation on Twitter when they are ready to post their annotation?
